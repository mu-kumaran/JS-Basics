💡 What is Map() in JavaScript?
A Map is a built-in JavaScript object that stores key–value pairs, similar to an object ({}), but with better features.

const store = new Map();
You can use it to set, get, and delete data, like a mini in-memory database — which is exactly what we did for OTP storage.

🔧 Syntax Breakdown (with Examples)
Let’s say we want to store OTPs per email:

const emailOTPStore = new Map();
🧾 .set(key, value)
Stores a value for a given key.

emailOTPStore.set("user@example.com", "123456");
👉 This stores:

{
  "user@example.com" => "123456"
}
✅ Can be any type (string, object, etc.)

🔍 .get(key)
Retrieves the value for the key.

const otp = emailOTPStore.get("user@example.com");
console.log(otp); // 👉 "123456"

❌ .delete(key)
Removes the key-value pair from the Map.

emailOTPStore.delete("user@example.com");
Now get() for this email will return undefined.

🔁 .has(key)
Checks whether a key exists.

if (emailOTPStore.has("user@example.com")) {
  console.log("OTP exists");
}
